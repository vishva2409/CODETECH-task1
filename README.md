DOMAIN: DATA SCIENCE
DURATION: 17th DECEMBER 2024 to 17th JANUARY 2025
**Overview of the Project: DATA SCIENCE**
**Project (TASK 1)**: EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA) ON Heart Disease Prediction Dataset
**Objective**:
Start with a dataset of your choice and perform EDA using libraries like pandas, numpy, and matplotlib or seaborn. Explore the data's characteristics, distributions, correlations, and outliers. Visualize your findings with histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to gain insights into the data.

Key Activities:

Data Preprocessing: 
    Improving the quality of the data and to make it more suitable for the specific data mining task.
Data Cleaning:
    Ensuring that the data is free from any inconsistencies and missing values.
Data Visualization:
    Performing visualizations to understand various trends, relationships and distributions.
Correlation Analysis:
    Identifying correlations between heart patients over the years on various key factors.

Inferences from the entire Project:
   
->Males are at higher risk of heart disease.
->Those who have never smoked have a higher rate of heart disease, and the lowest rate is in those who are former smokers. People who have a family history of heart disease are more likely to develop it.
->Diabetics are more likely to get heart disease.
->Numerical data analysis gives insights into median values and skewness.
->Columns with zero skewness indicate that the mean and median values are the same.
->The average cholesterol levels are high in the sample data.
->We have heart disease rate of 39.2 percent.
